    "content": "Code of Conduct . Trust, respect, collaboration and transparency are core values we believe should live and breathe within our projects. Our community welcomes participants from around the world with different experiences, unique perspectives, and great ideas to share. . Our Pledge . In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. . Our Standards . Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include: . Using welcoming and inclusive language | Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences | Gracefully accepting constructive criticism | Attempting collaboration before conflict | Focusing on what is best for the community | Showing empathy towards other community members | . Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include: . Violence, threats of violence, or inciting others to commit self-harm | The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances | Trolling, intentionally spreading misinformation, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks | Public or private harassment | Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission | Abuse of the reporting process to intentionally harass or exclude others | Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior | Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting | . Our Responsibilities . Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. . Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. . Scope . This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers. . Enforcement . Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at opensource@coloredcow.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. . Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership. . If you are unsure whether an incident is a violation, or whether the space where the incident took place is covered by our Code of Conduct, we encourage you to still report it. We would prefer to have a few extra reports where we decide to take no action, than to leave an incident go unnoticed and unresolved that may result in an individual or group to feel like they can no longer participate in the community. Reports deemed as not a violation will also allow us to improve our Code of Conduct and processes surrounding it. If you witness a dangerous situation or someone in distress, we encourage you to report even if you are only an observer. . Attribution . This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 1.4, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html. .",

    "content": "General Contributing guidelines . A big welcome and thank you for considering contributing to Project Tides! It’s people like you that make it a reality for users in our community. . Reading and following these guidelines will help us make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved. It also communicates that you agree to respect the time of the developers managing and developing these open source projects. In return, we will reciprocate that respect by addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests. . Quicklinks . General Contributing guidelines Quicklinks | Getting Started Issues | Pull Requests | . | . | . Getting Started . Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both: . If you discover a security vulnerability, please send an e-mail to opensource@coloredcow.com. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed. | Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own. | We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking. | . Issues . Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate. . If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you’re having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a reaction can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter. . Pull Requests . PRs are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should: . Only fix/add the functionality in question OR address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both. | Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists). | Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible. | Include documentation in the repo. | Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created). | . For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it’s best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes. . In general, we follow the “fork-and-pull” Git workflow . Fork the repository to your own Github account | Clone the project to your machine | Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name | Commit changes to the branch | Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo | Push changes to your fork | Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes. |",

    "content": "Project Tides . Tides is a two-way chat platform between NGOs and their impact community that is built using WhatsApp API. The platform allows NGOs to chat with each of their beneficiaries and help them to uplift their lives. NGOs can work in various sectors such as healthcare, education, women empowerment, and more… so for education, an NGO can chat with a beneficiary to help them with the admission process, share study material or learn other ways they can intervene. . About the prototype . This prototype repository covers the various technologies, connect the dots and test a working model of the platform. A most basic use case of the application is used to build the prototype. It follows like this: . A beneficiary will be able to message an NGO user via WhatsApp. | The message will be visible on the platform. | It will get labeled with relevant keywords. | A basic response will be suggested too. | The NPO user will use the suggestion from the system to form a response and then send it to the beneficiary. | .
